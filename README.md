# Health Care Analysis for Diabetes Prediction

### Overview
This project involves analyzing healthcare data to predict diabetes outcomes using various statistical tests and machine learning techniques. The analysis focuses on data preprocessing, balancing the dataset, and building machine learning models to predict whether an individual is diabetic based on several features like BMI, Age, and Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG).

### Key Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset.
- Use statistical tests (T-Test, Mann-Whitney, Levene's Test) to select significant features.
- Handle class imbalance using **SMOTE**.
- Build machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict diabetes status.
- Evaluate models based on metrics like **Accuracy**, **F1 Score**, and **Classification Report**.

### Key Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Categorical features were encoded using label encoding.
   - Missing values were handled, and the dataset was prepared for modeling.
   
2. **Class Imbalance Handling**:
   - Applied **SMOTE** to address the imbalance in the target variable (diabetic vs. non-diabetic cases).

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** were implemented to predict the diabetes status.
   - The models were evaluated based on **Accuracy**, **F1 Score**, and **Classification Reports**.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - **T-Test**, **Mann-Whitney U Test**, and **Leveneâ€™s Test** were used to assess the statistical significance of features.
   
5. **Visualization**:
   - Multiple plots were created to understand the distribution of features and their relationship to diabetes status.
